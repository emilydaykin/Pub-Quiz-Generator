## General Approach:

Initially, we decided to work with a free API from cocktail DB. Upon working with it and realising that our goals were somewhat limited by the API, and overshadowed by the corresponding website, we changed the API to one from API ninja, called trivia. Our new aim was to create a website that could be used to form a list of trivia questions that you could use to make a pub quiz, the user would navigate via category to a random selection of questions, and pick those they wanted to compile into a list, which the site would display.

We began by pseudocoding out the necessary code and design of the different components.
